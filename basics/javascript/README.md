## How to read files in this section

This section covers basic javascript topics using two type of files i.e. topic.js and topic.html. `topic.js` demonstrates the javascript topic under discussion and `topic.html` just includes the javascript file which then can be viewed in the browser.

`Example`: arrays.js cover how to work with arrays in javascript and arrays.html includes arrays.js so that we can open console logs and verify our code.

### Hot reloading
