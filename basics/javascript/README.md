## How to read files in this section

This section covers basic javascript topics using two type of files i.e. topic.js and topic.html. `topic.js` demonstrates the javascript topic under discussion and `topic.html` just includes the javascript file which then can be viewed in the browser.

`Example`: arrays.js cover how to work with arrays in javascript and arrays.html includes arrays.js so that we can open console logs and verify our code.

### Hot reloading

- I recommend you follow below steps before reading these javascript files. 
  - Download and install node js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
  - install live-server:
    - `npm install live-server -g`
  - After the previous step, you will have everything you need for testing your javascript code dynamically. 
  - Go to the directory which has your javascript code and start live-server using below command:
    - `live-server`
    `output`:
    `full-stack-developer-journey/basics/javascript" at http://127.0.0.1:8080
     Ready for changes
     GET /favicon.ico 404 1.929 ms - 150`
  - This will automatically open a browser window/tab and will show the list of files present in the directory. You can now make code changes on the fly and see the reflected changes right away. Have fun :)
